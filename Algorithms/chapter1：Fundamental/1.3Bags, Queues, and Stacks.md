#1.3  Bags, Queues, and Stacks

Several fundamental data types involve collections of objects. Specifically, the set of values is a collection of objects, and the operations revolve around adding, removing, or examining objects in the collection. In this section, we consider three such data types, known as the bag, the queue, and the stack. They differ in the specification of which object is to be removed or examined next.

##APIS
We define the APIs for bags, queues, and stacks. Beyond the basics, these APIs reflect two Java features: generics and iterable collections.

* Generics.
	
	 An essential characteristic of collection ADTs is that we should be able to use them for any type of data. A specific Java mechanism known as generics enables this capability. The notation <Item> after the class name in each of our APIs defines the name Item as a type parameter, a symbolic placeholder for some concrete type to be used by the client. You can read Stack<Item> as "stack of items." For example, you can write code such as：
	
		Stack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();
		stack.push("Test");
		...
		String next = stack.pop(); 

	to use a stack for String objects.
* Autoboxing. 
	
	Type parameters have to be instantiated as reference types, so Java automatically converts between a primitive type and its corresponding wrapper type in assignments, method arguments, and arithmetic/logic expressions. This conversion enables us to use generics with primitive types, as in the following code:

		Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
		stack.push(17);        // auto-boxing (int -> Integer)
		int i = stack.pop();   // auto-unboxing (Integer -> int)
	Automatically casting a primitive type to a wrapper type is known as autoboxing, and automatically casting a wrapper type to a primitive type is known as auto-unboxing.
* Iterable collections.

	 For many applications, the client's requirement is just to process each of the items in some way, or to iterate through the items in the collection. Java's foreach statement supports this paradigm. For example, suppose that collection is a Queue<Transaction>. Then, if the collection is iterable, the client can print a transaction list with a single statement:

		for (Transaction t : collection)
   		StdOut.println(t);

* Bags. 
	
	A bag is a collection where removing items is not supported—its purpose is to provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected items. Stats.java is a bag client that reads a sequence of real numbers from standard input and prints out their mean and standard deviation.

* FIFO queues. 
	
	A FIFO queue is a collection that is based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) policy. The policy of doing tasks in the same order that they arrive server is one that we encounter frequently in everyday life: from people waiting in line at a theater, to cars waiting in line at a toll booth, to tasks waiting to be serviced by an application on your computer.
* Pushdown stack.
	
	 A pushdown stack is a collection that is based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) policy. When you click a hyperlink, your browser displays the new page (and pushes onto a stack). You can keep clicking on hyperlinks to visit new pages, but you can always revisit the previous page by clicking the back button (popping it from the stack). Reverse.java is a stack client that reads a sequence of integers from standard input and prints them in reverse order.
* Arithmetic expression evaluation. Evaluate.java is a stack client that evaluates fully parenthesized arithmetic expressions. It uses Dijkstra's 2-stack algorithm:
	* Push operands onto the operand stack.
	* Push operators onto the operator stack.
	* Ignore left parentheses.
	* On encountering a right parenthesis, pop an operator, pop the requisite number of operands, and push onto the operand stack the result of applying that operator to those operands.

This code is a simple example of an interpreter.

##Array and resizing array implementations of collections.

* Fixed-capacity stack of strings. FixedCapacityStackOfString.java implements a fixed-capacity stack of strings using an array.
* Fixed-capacity generic stack. FixedCapacityStack.java implements a generic fixed-capacity stack.
* Array resizing stack. ResizingArrayStack.java implements a generic stack using a resizing array. With a resizing array, we dynamically adjust the size of the array so that it is both sufficiently large to hold all of the items and not so large as to waste an excessive amount of space. We double the size of the array in push() if it is full; we halve the size of the array in pop() if it is less than one-quarter full.
* Array resizing queue. ResizingArrayQueue.java implements the queue API with a resizing array.
## Linked lists.
	
A linked list is a recursive data structure that is either empty (null) or a reference to a node having a generic item and a reference to a linked list. To implement a linked list, we start with a nested class that defines the node abstraction

	private class Node {
	   Item item;
	   Node next;
	}

* Building a linked list. To build a linked list that contains the items to, be, and or, we create a Node for each item, set the item field in each of the nodes to the desired value, and set the next fields to build the linked list.

* Insert at the beginning. The easiest place to insert a new node in a linked list is at the beginning.
![](https://github.com/timosang/AndroidDemo/blob/master/Algorithms/chapter1%EF%BC%9AFundamental/pic/linked-list-insert-front.png)
* Remove from the beginning. Removing the first node in a linked list is also easy.
![](https://github.com/timosang/AndroidDemo/blob/master/Algorithms/chapter1%EF%BC%9AFundamental/pic/linked-list-remove-first.png)
* Insert at the end. To insert a node at the end of a linked list, we maintain a link to the last node in the list.
![](https://github.com/timosang/AndroidDemo/blob/master/Algorithms/chapter1%EF%BC%9AFundamental/pic/linked-list-insert-end.png)
* Traversal. The following is the idiom for traversing the nodes in a linked list
		
		for (Node x = first; x != null; x = x.next) {
		   // process x.item
		}

##Linked-list implementations of collections.

* Linked list implementation of a stack. Stack.java implements a generic stack using a linked list. It maintains the stack as a linked list, with the top of the stack at the beginning, referenced by an instance variable first. To push() an item, we add it to the beginning of the list; to pop() an item, we remove it from the beginning of the list.
* Linked list implementation of a queue. Program Queue.java implements a generic FIFO queue using a linked list. It maintains the queue as a linked list in order from least recently to most recently added items, with the beginning of the queue referenced by an instance variable first and the end of the queue referenced by an instance variable last. To enqueue() an item, we add it to the end of the list; to dequeue() an item, we remove it from the beginning of the list.
* Linked list implementation of a bag. Program Bag.java implements a generic bag using a linked list. The implementation is the same as Stack.java except for changing the name of push() to add() and removing pop().

##Iteration. 

To consider the task of implementing iteration, we start with a snippet of client code that prints all of the items in a collection of strings, one per line:

	Stack<String> collection = new Stack<String>();
	...
	for (String s : collection)
	   StdOut.println(s);
	...

This foreach statement is shorthand for the following while statement:

	Iterator<String> i = collection.iterator();
	while (i.hasNext()) { 
   		String s = i.next();
   		StdOut.println(s);
	}

To implement iteration in a collection:

* Include the following import statement so that our code can refer to Java's java.util.Iterator interface:
	
		import java.util.Iterator;
* Add the following to the class declaration, a promise to provide an iterator() method, as specified in the java.lang.Iterable interface:

		implements Iterable<Item>
* Implement a method iterator() that returns an object from a class that implements the Iterator interface:

		public Iterator<Item> iterator() {
    		return new ListIterator();
		}
* Implement a nested class that implements the Iterator interface by including the methods hasNext(), next(), and remove(). We always use an empty method for the optional remove() method because interleaving iteration with operations that modify the data structure is best avoided.
	* The nested class ListIterator in Bag.java illustrates how to implement a class that implements the Iterator interface when the underlying data structure is a linked list.
	* The nested class ArrayIterator in ResizingArrayBag.java does the same when the underlying data structure is an array.
