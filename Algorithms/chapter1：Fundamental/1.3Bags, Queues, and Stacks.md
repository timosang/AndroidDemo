#1.3  Bags, Queues, and Stacks

Several fundamental data types involve collections of objects. Specifically, the set of values is a collection of objects, and the operations revolve around adding, removing, or examining objects in the collection. In this section, we consider three such data types, known as the bag, the queue, and the stack. They differ in the specification of which object is to be removed or examined next.

We define the APIs for bags, queues, and stacks. Beyond the basics, these APIs reflect two Java features: generics and iterable collections.
